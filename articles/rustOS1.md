# Replicate xv6 on rust #1 RISC-V

In [previous article](http://www.url.com) we talked about operating system as an abstraction over hardware, so knowing your hardware well enough is the first step of the whole journey. The ISA we gonna use is RISC-V. Most of references are from [The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Volume II](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/papers/riscv-privileged-v1.9.1.pdf), and [instruction reference](https://msyksphinz-self.github.io/riscv-isadoc/html/rvi.html#auipc). There are a lot of details to learn to truly understand RISC-V, but we will only look at stuffs we care about for writing an OS.

## Machine architecture

## Some Jargons

## Registers

## Privilege level

## Control and status register

## Instructions
