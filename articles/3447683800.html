<h2>C++ Template as A Langauge</h2>
<br/>
<p>Templates was added into C++ in it's third release (1991) to support parametric polymorphism, and it was soon be discovered to be much more powerful then it's original design goal. It was proven to be <a href="https://rtraba.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/cppturing.pdf">turning complete</a>, although you cannot directly perform IO with it, technically you can do any other computations with just templates and template specializations. The earliest recorded template abuse I could find was <a href="http://www.erwin-unruh.de/primorig.html">this little program</a> written by Erwin Unruh in 1994 to calculate prime at compile time. Ever since then, C++ templates have became a powerful tool not only enpowering generic programming and meta programming techniques, but also being an ideal tool for recreational programming purpose :p.</p>
<p>I find the descrption &quot;turning complete&quot; a bit unsatisfied. I mean sure you can encode some turing machines and watch the compiler move tapes, or you can implement a <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/c++-template-meta-programming-with-lambda-calculus/">sicp style interpreter</a>, which itself is turning complete.</p>
