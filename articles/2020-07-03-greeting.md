# Greeting

Hello world!

This website is largely my personal note keeper. It is a static site built with `markdowndb.macro`, a babel macro helps you manage your markdown files easier without add too much runtime overhead.

[`articles`](#/articles) is where I put all the articles.

[`notes`](#/notes) here is mostly tautology, I just rephrase what I read.

[`others`](#/others) stuffs I don't know where to put.

Have a nice day.
