### Greeting

<br/>

Hello world!

This website is largely my personal note keeper. It is a static site built with `markdowndb.macro`, a babel macro helps you manage markdown files easier without adding too much runtime overhead.

[`articles`](#/articles) is where I put all the articles.

[`notes`](#/notes) contains my notes. I find writing stuffs down is very helpful for remembering what I did, no matter how clumsy they are :)

Have a nice day.
