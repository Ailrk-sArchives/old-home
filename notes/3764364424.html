<h1>Some llvm-hs</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>LLVM is designed to be as modular as possible, so as long as a binding can bind all the apis llvm provides, you can have the full contorl of llvm on another language. There is an inital llvm ocaml binding, and that's how rust was initially written in. With <code>llvm-hs</code> haskell can take advantage of this pipeline too. To use <code>llvm-hs</code> you need two libraries namye <code>llvm-hs</code> and <code>llvm-hs-pure</code>. <code>llvm-hs-pure</code> provides pure types and functions for haskell to interact with llvm, and <code>llvm-hs</code> use with FFI binding to llvm.</p>
