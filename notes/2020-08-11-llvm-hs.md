# Some llvm-hs

## LLVM Overview
LLVM has bunch of subprojects, which make it hard to navigate for newbies like me. Normally when people address LLVM `ir` they are talking about the [`llvm-core`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/master/llvm/lib) library. It's the library that provides code generations and `target and source` independent optimizations. Many of other subprojects are around providing support for `clang`, which is not really important for writing your own compiler.
