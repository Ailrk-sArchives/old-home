<h1>A little xmonas case study</h1>
<p>Everybody seems to like xmonad so much, but I always feel like it's because other than xmonad there are not many popular haskell applications to talk about. Even for xmonad, tiling window manager is already kind of a niche program itself.</p>
<p>The value of xmonad is it manage state in a purely functional way. There is probably nothing more stateful than window moving on the screen, and Xmonad proved haskell can do it very well.</p>

<h2>Window manager</h2>
<p>Xmonad is a tiling window manger. A tiling window manager can be modeled as a set of virtual workspaces. On each workspaces there is a stack of windows. On each workspaces there will be one winodow that currently on focus. A window is on current workspace and currently on focus will be the one that takes user input.</p>
