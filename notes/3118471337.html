<h1>Lambda Calculus</h1>
<h2>Compare with turing machine</h2>
<p>Both lambda calclus and turing machines are both turing complete computational model.</p>
<h4>Turing machine</h4>
<p>Basic idea: A state machine read and write on a infinite tape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>The model match today's hardware very well. (You can easily make the analogy between pointer-tape and cpu-memory.)</li>
<li>It's easy to measure conplexity. (The amount of instructions can be a straight forward measurement.)</li>
<li>The model is easy to reason about: (Write data to memory, and read it laster to decide the future actions.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lambda Calculus</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Simpler to represent lost of operation. (Some simple tasks like multiplication is hard to implement in turing machine. Look at how mutiplication is implemented at instruction level.)</li>
<li>Solves the halting problem with typed lambda.</li>
<li>Provable. (Curry Howard isomorphism. The isomorphism is between typed lambda calculus and propositions, there is no such notion for turing machine)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
