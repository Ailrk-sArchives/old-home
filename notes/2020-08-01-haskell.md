# Some polymorphism, some mtl, some lazyness

## polymorphism in haskell
##### ad hoc polymorphism
Ad hoc polymorhism means a value can adopt any one of several types. For instance, function overloading (so does operator overloading of course) allows taking parameter with different types, so it's a example of ad hoc polymorphism.

Typeclass achieve ad hoc polymorphism by providing an instance for each type implements the class. But besides this property a typeclass can also put constraint on type parameter, and that doesn't convey "ad hoc" feature, thus is not ad hoc polymorphism.

So strip down, implementing different instances for each type and overloading for different parameters are really the same thing.

Because typeclass has multi purpose, I was confusd by which part corresponds to ad hoc polymorpism.  [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63221632/is-this-understanding-correct-trait-and-function-overloading-both-achieved-ad-h) answer helped a lot!

##### parametric polymorpism
Referes to when a type of a value contains one or more unconstrained type variable. Unconstraied because if it is constrained, it lose gene generality and become ad hoc polymorpism. The type parameters then can be substituted by concrete types to form a concrete type.
If you think of a parametric polymorphic function first as a regular function that takes values as parameters, and besides that it takes concrete types too, then it can be regard as a `type to value mapping`.

## Type system
##### Rank N type
Rank N type is used to express polymorphic function as first class value. With higher ranked type you can pass a polymorphic function and constraint the type parameter in only one parameter. N means how deeply the type parameter is nested.
```haskell
-- example rank 1 and rank n.
rank1 :: forall n. Num n => (n -> n) -> (Int, Int)
rank1 f = (f 1 :: Int, f 2 :: Int)
rank2 :: (forall n. Num n => n -> n) -> (Int, Double)
rank2 f = (f 1, f 1.0)
```
For `rank1`, we first choose n then provide the function, so in this case the function `f` only works for the type n passed in.
For `rank2`, we provide function before we know the concrete type of n. This implies the function must be polymorphic over n, so `f` works for any type n as long as it has Num constraint.
You can apply f to both `Int` and `Double` in the `rank2` example because f is polymorphic (f has type `Num n => n -> n` after it is passed in), but for `rank1` you can only apply one type because once n is inferred, f can only become one type (once f is applied to Int in the first argument, it can only be a function of type `Int -> Int`).

##### Type operator
Function in type level that map a type to another type. People call it `type operator`, not type level funtion!

##### Higher kinded type
Type operator itself can be parameterized by other type operators. A concrete type is just a conrete thing, denoted as `*`. `* -> *` implies this type requires another
type as its "kind parameter" to make a concrete type.
Type operator is `mapping from type to type`. Higher kinded type generalized this dea and type operator first class in type level.

## ST Monad
##### ST monad and Rank N type.
In place updatable state
pure interface to the external
use rank 2 type to ensure encapsulation of the state.
```haskell
runST :: forall a. (forall s. ST s a) -> a
```

## Haskell Lib overview
Need a general overview rather than trail and errors

#### Classification
##### Prelude
Prelude is the default lib that automatically get imported.

##### Standard library
Defined in the language standard, but you must import to use them

##### Hackage library
Npm style package system.

#### Some common functions
##### Maybe
``` haskell
isJust :: Maybe a -> Bool
isJust (Just _) = True
isJust Nothing = Fals

isNothing ::  May a -> Bool
isNothing = not . isJust

-- map (a -> b) into May a, if get nothing return default b.
maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
maybe _ f (Just x) = f x
maybe z _ Nothing = z

fromMaybe :: a -> Maybe a -> a
fromMaybe z = maybe z id

ListToMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
ListToMaybe [] = Nothing
ListToMaybe (x:_) = Just x

MaybeToList :: Maybe a -> [a]
MaybeToList Nothing -> []
MaybeToList (Just x) -> [x]

catMaybes :: [Maybe a] -> [a]
catMaybes ms = [ x | Just x <- ms ]

mapMaybe :: (a -> Maybe b) -> [a] -> [b]
mapMaybe f xs = catMaybes (f <$> xs)

mapMaybe :: (a -> Maybe b) -> [a] -> [b]
mapMaybe _ [] = []
mapMaybe f (x:xs) =
    case f x of
        Just x -> y : mapMaybe f xs
        Nothing -> mapMaybe f xs

sequence :: [Maybe a] -> Maybe [a]
sequence [] = Just []
sequencen (Nothing:xs) = Nothing
sequence (Just x:xs) = case sequence xs of
    Just xs' -> Just (x:xs')
    _ -> Nothing
```

#### IO (System.IO)
```haskell
-- Some basic file IOs.
data IOMode = ReadMode | WriteMode | AppendMode | ReadWriteMode
type FilePath = String

openFile :: FilePath -> IOMode -> IO Handle
hClose :: Handle -> IO ()

hIsEOF :: Handle -> IO Bool

hGetChar :: Handle -> IO Char
hGetLine :: Handle -> IO String
hGetContents :: Handle -> IO String

getChar :: IO Char
getLine :: IO String
getContents :: IO String

hPutChar :: Handle -> Char -> IO ()
hPutStr :: Handle -> String -> IO ()
hPutStrLn :: Handle -> String -> IO ()

putChar :: Char -> IO ()
putStr :: String -> IO ()
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()

readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO ()
```
##### bracket (Control.Exception)
`bracket` helps perform actions safely.
```haskell
bracket :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> (a -> IO c) -> IO c

-- Like a context manager, even when `hPutChar` fails the
-- file will still be closed.
writeChar :: FilePath -> Char -> IO ()
writeChar fp c =
    bracket
        (openFile p WriteMode)
        hClose
        (\h -> hPutChar h c)
```

#### Random
Because haskell is purely functional, it returns a new random number generator with `next`rather than use some hidden side effect to mutate the state of the generator.  The generator is still pure function, so if you call `next` with the same generator three times, it will generate the same output. To get different output you need to rewire the new geneartor to the next step.
```haskell
-- newStdGen get `StdGen` Pseudorandom number generator
-- state.
foo = do
    gen <- newStdGen
    let ns = randoms get :: [Int]
    print $ take 10 ns

-- make `StdGeen` with a given seed.
randomList :: (Random a) => Int -> [a]
randomList seed = randoms (mkStdGen seed)

randomList1 :: IO ()
randomList =
    do gen <- newStdGen
    interact $ unlines . unsort gen . lines
   where
       unsort :: (RandomGen g) => g -> [x] -> [x]
       unsort g es = map snd . sortBy (comparig fst) $ zip rs es
           where rs = randoms g :: [Ingeter]

```

##### Some definition from `System.Random`
`Random a` provides an ergonomic interface to generate random numbers without worrying about the generator state.
```haskell
data StdGen = ...
class RandomGen g where
    genRange :: g -> (Int, Int)
    next :: g -> (Int, g)
    split :: g -> (g, g)
instance RandomGen StdGen where ...
instance Read StdGen where ...
instance Show StdGen where ...
-- StdGen is the only instance of RandomGen

class Random a where
    randomR :: RandomGen g => (a, a) -> g -> (a, g)
    random :: RandomGen g => g -> (a, g)

    randomRs :: RandomGen g => (a, a) -> g -> [a]
    randoms :: RandomGen g => g -> [a]

    randomIO :: (a, a) -> IO a
    randoms :: IO a
```

##### Global randome generator
To avoid write the clumsy code above even for some quick dirty jobs, there are functions to work with global randome number generators.
```haskell
newStdGen :: IO StdGen
setStdGen :: StdGen -> IO ()
getStdGen :: IO StdGen
getStdRandom :: (StdGen -> (a, StdGen)) -> IO a

doo :: IO Int
doo = do
    r1 <- getStdGen
    let (x, r2) = randomR (0, 999) r1
    setStdGen r2
    return x
```

#### Data structure primer
##### List trade offs
Despite not being the best data structure for most tasks, list works well with haskell's lazy, purely functional setting. Laziness allows you to use list as a stream, and value get evaluated by needs. In things like nodejs or java you have some stream classes to deal with sequential data, but in haskell the laziness implies those the functinality already.

##### lookup Data.Map
There is a `lookup :: Eq k => k -> [(k, v)] -> Maybe v` in the prelude, but it is not very efficient. Because there is no requirement for the list to be ordered, you even cannot use binary search. So essentially the function becomes a linear search. Instead, use `Data.Map` from `containers` package. It's a binary tree implementation.

```haskell
import qualified Data.Map as M

emptyMap = M.empty
foo = M.fromList [(1, "Robert"), (5, "Ian")]
name = M.lookup 1 foo

unionedSize = M.size $ M.union foo $ M.fromList [(11, "Andrew")]
```

###### Variations
- `Data.IntMap` is limited to int key but has more efficient implementation.
- `Data.Set` provides set implementation
- `unordered-containers` implements hashtable.

#### Data.Sequence
List is asymmetric. By that it means access the head of a list with `(:)` is more efficient than get the element at the tail. `\xs x -> xs [x]`  is a bad way of adding stuff to the end of the list becuase it needs traverse the entire list to find the tail first.

To be able to access the tail more efficiently, `Data.Sequence` is a better choice. List is lazy and infinite while sequence is strict and finite.

```haskell
import qualified Data.Sequence as S
import Data.Sequence ((<|), (|>), (><), ViewL(..), ViewR(..))
let foo = S. fromList [1, 3, 5, 2, 9]
let foo1 = 0 <| foo
let foo2 = foo |> 18
let foo3 = foo >< foo
-- view can be used to pattern match
let xs :> x = S.viewr foo
let xs' <: s' = S.viewl foo
```

#### Raw performance with array. `vector`, `array`, `repa`.
When it comes to process large bulk of data, list and sequence are nolonger suitable anymore, we need something more like a traditional c array. Haskell provides multiple types of arrays, and here is the three most used ones:

- `vector`: Not like c++ vector, in haskell you don't push pack and resize automatically.
- `array`: Support multidimensional array, but it's harder to use.
- `repa`: State-of-the-art multidimensional array.

#### Text Bytestring and string.
##### Problem with String
- Performance is pretty bad (List of Char cliche).
- For binary data `Char` based implementation makes little sense.
- `Char` in haskell is Unicode characters, no support for other encodings.

##### Text and Bytestring
`Text` and `ByteString` are monomorphic cotainers of `Char` and `Word8` respectively. The internal representation is array based and very compact. Both data structures have `Lazy` and `Strict` versions. `Strict` version is just like how you use bytestring in other languages, and `Lazy` provides streaming experience.
