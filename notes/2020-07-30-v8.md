# Note: Overview of js ecosystem
Some overview of support for js as a language. Frameworks like React and vue doesn't count as language support since they are stand alone project.

## node overview
##### 1. event loop

##### 2. libuv

##### 3. web assembly

##### 4. timer

##### 5. apis

##### 6. libuv

## babel
##### 1. code transformation

##### 2. visitor pattern on AST.

##### 3. build ast.

##### 4. babal plugin

##### 2. babel macro

## Runtime
##### 1. v8 overview

##### 2. JIT

##### 3. GC

##### 4. interleave between interpreter and compiler

##### 5. Turbo Fan

##### 6. inlining optimization

##### 7. hidden class optimization

##### 8. inline caching.

##### 9. ignition

##### 10. exploit v8
__1__ Hidden class related (keey data the same shape so they can share the same hidden class):
  - Instantiate objects' properties in the same order.
  - Avoid dynamically adding property. If possible, instantiating all properties up front.

__2__ Inline caching related.
  - Run the same method repeatdely is more optimized than run many methods only once.


## JS builtin (by standard)
Overall of all JS builtin. Js has more builtin than most other languages, everything kinda floating in the global scope. It is probably because of this initial intention as being a scripting language.
##### 1. values
- Infinity
- NaN
- undefined (Note `undefined` is a builtin value property, but `null` is not)
- globalThis.

##### 2. functions
- eval() (metaprogramming can use it. but even for metaprogramming this is way too filthy)
- isFinite()
- isNaN()
- parseFloat()
- parseInt()
- encodeURI() (replacing each instance of some chars into escape seq for transfer)
- encodeURIComponent()
- decodeURI()
- decodeURIComponent()
Some functions like `parseInt` really should not be in global namespace.

##### 3. Objects
- Object
- Function
- Boolean
- Symbol
At runtime js only recognize this four objects. These plus primitive can be tested with `typeof`

##### 4. Erros
- Error (Really it should be called runtime error)
- AggregateError (Error Burritos. In haskell it can be easily done with Either and applicative)
- EvalError (Filthy)
- RangeError (IndexOutOfBound?)
- ReferenceError (As it called. Dangling pointer)
- SyntaxError
- TypeError (This is a joke)
- URIError (This is way too specific)

##### 5. Numbers
- Math (this is a singleton namespace)
- BigInt (arbitrary digit integer. The primitive `number` max at 2^53 -1)
- Number (`1` is `double`, but `1|0` will coerce to integer)
- Date (11 is Dec !!! I failed multiple times on this)

##### 6. Text processing
- String
  - String.raw() (return a string created from a raw template string)
  - String.fromCharCode(num1 [, ...])
  - String.fromCodePoint(num1 [, ...])
- RegExp
__1__. What's the difference between CharCode and CodePoint? CharCode is utf-16 and CodePoint is Unicode. Why don't they use a better name for them? No idea.
__2__. RegExp can be constructed by it's syntax sugar or by constructor. I don't thinn regex is special enough to deserve it's own syntax, so I probably use constructed more often.

##### 7. Indexed Collections
- Array (mutable, heterogenous array list)
  - Array.from() (You can not iterate over a `IterableIterator`, This is your Iterator. HAHA)
  - Array.isArray()
  - Array.of() (it's `pure` for Array Applicative)
  - Array.prototye.slice() (main function for immutability. You copy rather mutate.)
  - Array.prototye.fill() (can be handy sometimes)
  - Array.prototye.forEach() It' map over `IO ()`
- Int8Array
  - Int8Array.property.buffer() (return A``ArrayBuffer``)
- UInt8Array
- Int8CampedArray (like UInt8Array but value won't overflow but bounded.)
- Int16Array
- UInt16Array
- Int32Array
- UInt32Array
- Float32Array
- Float64Array
- BigInt64Array (Why does it needs a `BIG` prefix when it comes to Int64?)
- BitUInt64Array
All this besides Array are called `TypedArray`, which are essentially different views of `ArrayBuffer`. You have all this fine grinded control over array element but no real standalone Int32 type..

##### 8. Keyed Collection
- Map ([`Deterministic Hash Table`](http://www.url.com) ordered by insertion order in iteration)
- Set (same implementation as `Map`)
- WeakMap (Like `WeakKeyMap` in `python`, avoid memory leak)
- WeakSet
This is hash table based collection. `WeakRef` is added to avoid awkward WeakMap work around.

##### 9. Structured data
- ArrayBuffer (fixed length byte array like you do all the time in C. You modify it via view like Typed Array.)
- SharedArrayBuffer (Shared Memory. Used for sharing data between workers)
- Atomics (namespace for atomic operations)
  - Atomics.add() Atomics.sub() Atomics.and() Atomics.or() Atomics.xor()
  - Atomics.compareExchange() (same as `test exchange`)
  - Atomics.exchange() (simply swap)
  - Atomics.wait() (unix `wait`)
  - Atomics.notfy() (notify waiting on the specifed index of the array)
  - Atomics.load() Atomics.store()
- DataView (Normalize endianness)
- JSON
  - JSON.parse(text) (parse into js object)
  - JSON.stringify(val) (from value to json)
__1__. Typically how you use `ArrayBuffer` is to create the buffer with bytes it holds, and create a new `TypedArray` on top of it to access it's content.
__2__. Shared data are based on TypedArray (SharedArrayBuffer). Even load, store are operations to help works with the shared buffer easier.
__3__. One thing to notice about JSON is that json has much simpler grammar rule, so it is faster to parse than javascript. So if there are a lot of data initialization, put them in one JSON file rather than javascript source code can improve the parsing performance. (Because of JIT Parsing speed is also an important performance factor of code execution)

##### 10. Control abstraction objects
- Promise (Future. One thing to note is `async await` sugar works for it. Some static methods comes very handy but few people use them)
  - Promise.all(iter) wait for all promises to resovle or any to be rejected.
  - Promise.any(iter) negation of `all`
  - Promise.race(iter) just return the value of the first resolved promise.
  - Promise.resolve(value) `pure` for promise
  - Promise.reject(reason) `pure` for promise error
- Generator (Just like python generator)
  - Generator.prototype.next()
  - Generator.prototype.return()
  - Generator.prototype.throw()
- GeneratorFunction (type for `function*(){}`)
- AsyncFunction (type for `async function(){}`)
__1__. Promise chaining style is really like monad sequencing...
__2__. Generator are good for making lazy data structure.
__3__. Async function is sugar (IRRELEVANT).

##### 11. Reflection
- Reflect (yet another namespace object, provides some interface to do runtime reflection)
  - Reflect.has(val, prop)
  - Reflect.ownKeys(val)
  - etc ...
- Proxy (target and handler)
Proxy is kinda like overwrite python descriptotr. But rather override the default behavior here you make a new interaface on top of the original object.

## prototype chain

## JS web api

## JS language features.
##### 1. generator
Js is really getting more and more like python. Generator is one of the key structure to achieve lazyiness in python. (other than forcibly wrap value into a lambda and call it a thunk).
