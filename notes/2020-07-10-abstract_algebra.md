# Some Abstract algebra

## Binary operation
let * =  `f : (S, S) → S`
associativity : `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`
commutativity : `a * b = b * a`

## Group
A set G with * a binary operation defined on G s.t
* is associative
∀ g in G, ∃ e ∈ G s.t, `g * e = e * g = g` (identity element)
∀ all g in G, ∃ h s.t `g * h = h * g = e` (has inverse)

## Some examples
#### Special Linear Group (Non abelian group // non commutative group)

###### define:
```
G = {∀2×2 complex matrices with determinant 1}
G = { |a b|  |  a, b, c, d ∈ ℂ ∧ ad - bc = 1 }
      |c d|
(*) is matrix multiplication
```

- Not for A, B in G, `det(A) = det(B) = 2` then `det(AB) = det(A) * det(B) = 1`, so AB ∈ G.
this shows * is a binary operation on G.

- proof associative: tautology
- identity:
    |1 0|
    |0 1| is also ∈ G.
- given any
        |a b|                                       |b  -b|     |b  -b|
    A = |c d| in G, it's inverse is: (1 / det(A)) * |-c  a| ==  |-c  a|
This shows (G, * ) is a group

#### General Linear Group

define:
```
G = {all 2x2 complex matrices with non zero determinant}
(*) = matrix multiplication
```

Note: special linear group is a subgroup of general linear group.

## cyclic group
###### define:
```
a cyclic group (or monogenous group) is a group that is generated by a single element.
every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group of Z (integerse).
every cyclic group of prime order is a simple group which cannot be broken down into smaller groups.
```

#### Additive group of integer modulo n

###### define:
```
Zₙ = {0, 1, 2, .... n - 1} // possible remander of diving by n
(*) = "addition modulo n"
0 = identity
```

###### define:
    `Z₄ = {0, 1, 2, 3},`
so 9 = 1
3 * 3 = 3 mod 4 + 3 mod 4 = 1 + 1 = 2
// think elements in Z₄ as equivalence classes.

#### Klein 4 group

###### define:
```
    V = {e, a, b, c}
    (*), associative
    a * e = e * a = a
    b * e = e * b = b
    c * e = e * c = c
    e * e = e

    a * b = c
    b * a = c

    a * c = b
    c * a = b

    b * c = a
    c * b = a

    a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e
```

###### properties:
```
    V is ablelian, everything commute.
    ! every proper subgroup is cyclic.
    V itself is not cyclic

    V is the smallest group that is not cyclic.

    These are the only subgroups Klein 4 groups have
    cyclic subgroup:  // e.g a * a * a * ...
        <e> = {e}
        <a> = {e, a}    // think a^0 = e, a = a, a^2 = e, a^3 = a * e = e ...
        <b> = {e, b}
        <c> = {e, c}
```

If a subgroup contain more than one element from Klein 4 group with identity,
it will essentially contain the entire group.


##### Subgroup lattice

              V
              .
              |
       +------+------+
       |      |      |
      <a>    <b>    <c>
       |      |      |
       +------+------+
              |
             <e>

#### Interesting group
###### define:
    let X be a set
    let G = PowerSet(X) = { ∀ S | S ⊆ X }
    let (▵) = "symmetric difference"
        where (▵) = given A, B in G, A ▵ B = (A  ̷  B) U (B  ̷ A)

###### proof:
```
    1. ▵ is associative
    2. {∅} is in G
    3. Inverse of A is A itself. Since ∀ A ∈ G, A ▵ A = A ▵  A ∪ A  ̷ A = ∅ U ∅ = ∅
    ∎
```

## Some proofs

#### Proof s set is a group.
Show all three properties of a group in definition.

#### Proof the identity element in a group is unique.

###### proof:
```
    given a group (G, *)
    suppose there exists e₁, and e₂ that are both identity elements.
    e₁ * e₂ = e₁
    e₁ * e₂ = e₂
    => e₁ = e₂
    ∎
```

#### Proof every element in a group has an unique inverse.

###### proof:
```
    Suppose x in (G, *), and y1, y2 are both inverse of x
    Then y₁
    = y₁ * e
    = y₁ * (x * y₂)
    = (y₁ * x) * y₂
    = e * y₂
    = y₂
    ∎
```

#### Proof in a group the inverse of g^(-1) is g, so (g^(-1))^(-1) = g
###### proof:
```
    Let (G, *) be a group and g in G.
    Note g * g^(-1) = g^(-1) * g = e
    This means g is the inverse of g^(-1)
    thus g = (g^(-1))^(-1)
    ∎
```

#### Proof
###### problem:
```
    Let G be a group and x, y in G,
    if either | xy = e
              | yx = e
    then y is the inverse of x.
    // by definition these two condition both need to hold to be inverse.
```

###### proof:
```
    Case 1
    suppose 1 holds, so xy = e
    then
    yx
    = (yx) e
    = (yx) (yy^(-1))
    = y (x(yy^(-1)))     by assoc
    = y( (xy) y^(-1))
    = y (ey^(-1))
    = y y^(-1)
    = e

    thus xy = e => yx = e
    thus y is inverse of x.

    Case 2
    suppose 2 holds, so yx = e
    ... Same as above
    ∎
```


## Cancellation Laws
###### statement:
    Suppose G in a group and a, b, c in G.
    1. if ab = ac then b = c
    2. if ac = bc then a = b

###### proof:
```
    proof 1:
        Suppose ab = ac
        then b
        = eb
        = (a^(-1)a) b
        = a^(-1) (ab)
        = a^(-1) (ac)
        = (a^(-1)a) c
        = ec
        = c
    Proof 2:
        Suppose ac = bc
        claim a = b
        then a
        = ae
        = a (cc^(-1))
        = (ac) c^(-1)
        = (bc) c^(-1)
        = b (cc^(-1))
        = be
        = b
    ∎
```
