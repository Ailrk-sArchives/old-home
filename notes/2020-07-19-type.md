# Note: Something about type theory 2020-07-19
##### 1. Type theory?
A formalism for program construction.

##### 2. constructive mathematics?
Type theory was initially aim of being a clarification of constructive math. Some mathematicians believe all proofs need to be able to be constructed from some primitive elements that we know they exists. (proof by contradiction is not a thing for constructivism). Constructive proof and program are related by Curry Howard correspondence.

##### 3. propositions as sets?
By curry howard correspondence. Set can be regarded as a proposition, whose elements represent the proofs of the proposition. If a proposition is false it means the "set" is empty. Btw: the "set" can also be viewd as problem description intuitively.

##### 4. Rule for making judgment
1. A is a set
2. A1 and A2 are equal sets
3. a is a element in the set A
4. a1 and a2 are equal elements in the set A
