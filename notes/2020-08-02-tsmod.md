# Typescript moduels and async in react.

## moduels in typescript

##### 1. modules execute on their own scope
Like all modern module systems. If all functions are pure then the module is just a namespace. But if there is state, since the module is scoped it can serve as a container, avoiding global state.

##### 2. ECMAScript
Any file containing top-level import or export is considered a module. Otherwise the file is treated as a script.

##### 3. re-export doesn't import value locally.
Re-export simply propagate the value to the next import.

##### 4. export * from "module";
Export everthing. This can be used as top level export.

##### 5. import for side effects.
If a module has no export, import it will simply execute it. It's useful for setting up an environment.

## async in react.
Async requets can cause some problems in react component.

##### 1. Async response can arrive after a component is teared down.
Async response can arrive after the component is unmounted. This will cause a react's runtime exception, which is an error message. Not a big deal but it can be better.
```typescript
const ismounted = useRef<boolean>(true);

useEffect(() => {
    return () => { ismounted.current = false; };
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
    const f = async () => { if (ismounted.current) setValue(await ...); }
}, []);
```

##### 2. Race condition
`useEffect` can depend on some prop, and when the prop update useEffect might send the async request again before the previous reuqest resolved. If the second request arrive eariler it will cause a race condition. Solution is to cancel the previous request when sending a new request. Or maybe use sequence number?
