<h2>LLVM Overview</h2>
<p>LLVM has bunch of subprojects, which make it hard to navigate for newbies like me. Normally when people address LLVM <code>ir</code> they are talking about the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/master/llvm/lib"><code>llvm-core</code></a> library. It's the library that provides code generations and <code>target and source</code> independent optimizations. Many of other subprojects are around providing support for <code>clang</code>, which is not really important for writing your own compiler.</p>
