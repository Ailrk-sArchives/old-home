# Note: some type theory #1
## Type theory 100
A formalism for program construction.

#### Constructive mathematics
Type theory was initially aim of being a clarification of constructive math. Some mathematicians believe all proofs need to be able to be constructed from some primitive elements that we know they exists. (proof by contradiction is not a thing for constructivism). Constructive proof and program are related by Curry Howard correspondence.

#### Propositions as sets
By Curry Howard correspondence. Set can be regarded as a proposition, whose elements represent the proofs of the proposition. If a proposition is false it means the "set" is empty. Btw: the "set" can also be viewd as problem description intuitively.

#### Rule for making judgment
1. A is a set
2. A1 and A2 are equal sets
3. a is a element in the set A
4. a1 and a2 are equal elements in the set A

## Type rule
Inference rule that describes how a type system assigns a type to a syntactic construction.

##### Notation
###### `⌈`: type environment (type context)
Represent the association between varfiable names and data types.

Judgement "e has type T in context ⌈" is written as `⌈ ⊢ e : T`

###### Sequents and inference rules
```
⌈₁ ⊢ e₁ : T₁  ... ⌈ₙ ⊢ eₙ : Tₙ    -- sequent (premises that must be fulfilled)
----------------------------
      ⌈ ⊢ e : T                   -- conclusion
```

An example for a real function
```
⌈ ⊢ e₁ : real  ... ⌈ ⊢ e₂ : real
----------------------------
      ⌈ ⊢ e₁ + e₂ : real
```

A type rule might have no premises with the omitted being omitted.

The deduction rules follows natural deduction.

## STLC

```
  Type ::=
          Type -> Type
          Bool
  term ::=
          var
          λvar: Type . term        -- annotated lambda
          term term                -- aplication
          true
          false
          if term then term else term -- boolean elimination

  ------------- (T-var)
  ⌈, x:T ⊢ x:T

    ⌈, x : S ⊢ e : T
  ----------------------- (T-Lam-Ann)
  ⌈ ⊢ λx : S . e : S → T

  ⌈ ⊢ f : S → T     ⌈ ⊢ x :S
  -------------------------- (T-App)
      ⌈ ⊢ f x : T

  -------------------- (T-True)
    ⌈ ⊢ true: Bool

  -------------------- (T-False)
    ⌈ ⊢ false : Bool

    ⌈ ⊢ b : Bool   ⌈ ⊢ x : T   ⌈ ⊢ y : T
  --------------------------------------- (T-If)
    ⌈ ⊢ if b then x else y : T

```
