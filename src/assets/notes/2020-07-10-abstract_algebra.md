# Some Abstract algebra 1

## Binary operation
let * =  `f : (S, S) → S`
associativity : `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`
commutativity : `a * b = b * a`

## Group
A set G with * a binary operation defined on G s.t
∀ f, g ∈ G, `f * g ∈ G` (closure)
* is associative
∀ g in G, ∃ e ∈ G s.t, `g * e = e * g = g` (identity element)
∀ all g in G, ∃ h s.t `g * h = h * g = e` (has inverse)

## Some examples
### Special Linear Group (Non abelian group // non commutative group)

#### define:
```
G = { ∀2×2 complex matrices with determinant 1 }
G = { |a b|  |  a, b, c, d ∈ ℂ ∧ ad - bc = 1 }
      |c d|
(*) is matrix multiplication
```

- Not for A, B in G, `det(A) = det(B) = 2`
  then `det(AB) = det(A) * det(B) = 1`, so AB ∈ G.
  this shows * is a binary operation on G.

- proof associative: tautology
- identity:
    |1 0|
    |0 1| is also ∈ G.
- given any
        |a b|
    A = |c d| in G, it's inverse is:
                     |b  -b|     |b  -b|
      (1 / det(A)) * |-c  a| ==  |-c  a|
This shows (G, * ) is a group

## General Linear Group

#### define:
```
G = {all 2×2 complex matrices with non zero determinant}
(*) = matrix multiplication
```

Note: special linear group is a subgroup of general linear group.

## Cyclic group
#### define:
```
A cyclic group (or monogenous group) is a group that is generated by
a single element. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the
additive group of Z (integerse).  every cyclic group of prime order
is a simple group which cannot be broken down into smaller groups.
```

## Abelian group:
#### define:
```
An abelian group, also called a commutative group, is a group in
which the result of applying the group operation to two group
elements does not depend on the order in which they are written.
That is, group operation is commutative.
```

### Additive group of integer modulo n
#### define:
```
Zₙ = {0, 1, 2, .... n - 1} // possible remander of diving by n
(*) = "addition modulo n"
0 = identity
```

#### define:
    `Z₄ = {0, 1, 2, 3},`
so 9 = 1
3 * 3 = 3 mod 4 + 3 mod 4 = 1 + 1 = 2
// think elements in Z₄ as equivalence classes.

### Klein 4 group
#### define:
```
    V = {e, a, b, c}
    (*), associative
    a * e = e * a = a
    b * e = e * b = b
    c * e = e * c = c
    e * e = e

    a * b = c
    b * a = c

    a * c = b
    c * a = b

    b * c = a
    c * b = a

    a² = b² = c² = e
```

#### properties:
```
    V is ablelian, everything commute.
    ! every proper subgroup is cyclic.
    V itself is not cyclic

    V is the smallest group that is not cyclic.

    These are the only subgroups Klein 4 groups have
    cyclic subgroup:  // e.g a * a * a * ...
        ⟨e⟩ = {e}
        ⟨a⟩ = {e, a}
        ⟨b⟩ = {e, b}
        ⟨c⟩ = {e, c}
        // think a⁰ = e, a = a, a² = e, a³ = a * e = e ...
```

If a subgroup contain more than one element from Klein 4 group with identity,
it will essentially contain the entire group.


#### Subgroup lattice
```
              V
              .
              |
       +------+------+
       |      |      |
      ⟨a⟩    ⟨b⟩    ⟨c⟩
       |      |      |
       +------+------+
              |
             ⟨e⟩
```

### Interesting group
#### define:
```
    let X be a set
    let G = PowerSet(X) = { ∀ S | S ⊆ X }
    let (▵) = "symmetric difference"
        where (▵) = given A, B in G, A ▵ B = (A  ̷  B) U (B  ̷ A)
```

#### proof:
```
    1. ▵ is associative
    2. {∅} is in G
    3. Inverse of A is A itself.
       Since ∀ A ∈ G, A ▵ A = A ▵  A ∪ A  ̷ A = ∅ U ∅ = ∅
    ∎
```

## Some proofs

### Proof s set is a group.
Show all three properties of a group in definition.

### Proof the identity element in a group is unique.
#### proof:
```
    given a group (G, *)
    suppose ∃ e₁, e₂, s.t both are identity elements.
    e₁ * e₂ = e₁
    e₁ * e₂ = e₂
    => e₁ = e₂
    ∎
```

### Proof every element in a group has an unique inverse.

#### proof:
```
    Suppose x in (G, *), and y1, y2 are both inverse of x
    Then y₁
    = y₁ * e
    = y₁ * (x * y₂)
    = (y₁ * x) * y₂
    = e * y₂
    = y₂
    ∎
```

### Proof in a group the inverse of g⁻¹ is g, so (g⁻¹)⁻¹ = g
#### proof:
```
    Let (G, *) be a group, g ∈ G.
    g * g⁻¹ = g⁻¹ * g = e, ∴ g is the inverse of g⁻¹.
    ∴ g = (g⁻¹)⁻¹.
    ∎
```

### Proof if either xy = e or yx = e then y is the inverse of x.

#### problem:
```
    Let G be a group and x, y in G,
    if either | xy = e
              | yx = e
    then y is the inverse of x.
    // by definition these two condition both need to hold to be
    // inverse.
```

#### proof:
```
    Case 1
    suppose 1 holds, so xy = e
    then
    yx
    = (yx) e
    = (yx) (yy⁻¹)
    = y (x(yy⁻¹))     by assoc
    = y( (xy) y⁻¹))
    = y (ey⁻¹)
    = y y⁻¹
    = e

    thus xy = e => yx = e
    thus y is inverse of x.

    Case 2
    suppose 2 holds, so yx = e
    ... Same as above
    ∎
```

## Cancellation Laws
#### statement:
```
  Suppose G in a group and a, b, c in G.
  1. if ab = ac then b = c
  2. if ac = bc then a = b
```

#### proof:
```
    proof 1:
        Suppose ab = ac
        then b
        = eb
        = (a⁻¹a) b
        = a⁻¹ (ab)
        = a⁻¹ (ac)
        = (a⁻¹a) c
        = ec
        = c
    Proof 2:
        Suppose ac = bc
        claim a = b
        then a
        = ae
        = a (cc⁻¹)
        = (ac) c⁻¹
        = (bc) c⁻¹
        = b (cc⁻¹)
        = be
        = b
    ∎
```
