# GHC runtime system

#### Overview of jobs rts does
- How to raise exception.
- How to allocate prim data structure `Array#`
- Contains a multi generational gc with copying and compacting strategies
- Contains a user space scheduler for haskell threads.
- Bytecode interpreter for ghci.
- Dynamic linker for loading object code into ghci.
- Heap profiling, time profiling, code coverage of haskell code included.
- Support for STM


#### Structure

```
                    c code
                     | (HsFFI.h)
================================================================ RTS
    Storage     |              |            |
   Management   |   Scheduler  |  Profiler  | ...
     (GC)       |              |            |
================================================================
                     | (StgRun)
                 compiled haskell
```

#### Storage
Besides a muti generational gc, there are some other components helps rts to manege storage.

##### Structure of storage management in rts.
```
        Haskell code
            |
     GC and other storage services
            |
      Block allocation layer
            |
           OS
```

##### Layout of heap object
###### Jargons
- `Bottom`  represent a computation which never completes successfully.
- `Lifted type` is a type that contains bottom (`_|_`). If a type is unlifed type, it doesn't contain bottom. For example `Array` is lifted and `ByteArray#` is unlifted.
- `Boxed type` is a pointer point to an heap object. `Unboxed type` is a value alone like `Int#`

Bottom `_|_` must be a pointer, and when evaluated, it will throw an exception. Unboxed types cannot be lifted since they will never contain bottom.

###### Heap object (Closures.h)
- All heap objects have the same basic layout.
- Heap object consists with header and payload.
- Header contains a info pointer
- Info pointer point to the info table for the closure.
```
+========+=================+
| Header |    Payload      |
+===|====+=================+
    |      +============+
    +----->| Info Table |
           +============+
           | Entry Code |
                ...
```

```c
typedef struct {
    const struct StgInfoTable* info;
#ifdef PROFILING
    StgProHeader prof;
#endif
} StgHeader;
```

__Info table__
A info table contains all information the runtime needsto know about the closure.
```
+=========================+
|        Layout           |  -- layout of payload. GC will use this info
+=========================+
|      Closure Type       |
+=========================+
|      SRT bitmap         |  -- used to support gc of CAFs
+=========================+
|         Code            |
|                         |
```
