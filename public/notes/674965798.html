<h1>Note: Something about type theory 2020-07-19</h1>
<h5>1. Type theory?</h5>
<p>A formalism for program construction.</p>
<h5>2. constructive mathematics?</h5>
<p>Type theory was initially aim of being a clarification of constructive math. Some mathematicians believe all proofs need to be able to be constructed from some primitive elements that we know they exists. (proof by contradiction is not a thing for constructivism). Constructive proof and program are related by Curry Howard correspondence.</p>
<h5>3. propositions as sets?</h5>
<p>By curry howard correspondence. Set can be regarded as a proposition, whose elements represent the proofs of the proposition. If a proposition is false it means the &quot;set&quot; is empty. Btw: the &quot;set&quot; can also be viewd as problem description intuitively.</p>
<h5>4. Rule for making judgment</h5>
<ol>
<li>A is a set</li>
<li>A1 and A2 are equal sets</li>
<li>a is a element in the set A</li>
<li>a1 and a2 are equal elements in the set A</li>
</ol>
