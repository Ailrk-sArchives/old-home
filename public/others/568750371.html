<h1>Canadian employment law</h1>
<h2>Employee and independent contractors</h2>
<p>Direct <code>contratual relationship</code> between a compnay and an individual.</p>
<h4>Employee</h4>
<ol>
<li>Employment-specific statutes</li>
<li>Administrative obligations</li>
<li>Reasonable notice for <code>indefinite hires</code> unless there are clear terms regarding termination of employment</li>
<li>Contract of service</li>
<li>Part of the business of the company.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Independent contractor</h4>
<ol>
<li>Fewer statutes apply</li>
<li>Fewer administrative obligations</li>
<li>Termination related oblgations are generally set out in the contract</li>
<li>Contract for services</li>
<li>In business for themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>Note</code> Independent contractor have deduction on EI (employment insurance) and CPP.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> Some people want to work as an independent contractor to its benefits.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> Some people are hired as independent contractor, and when they are let go they claim they actually works as an employee, so they can ask for severance pay from the employer.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> Independent contractor will not be fired, the employer just end the contract with them.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> The termination of independent contractor will first based on the agreement, then seeking for evidence of oral agreements.</p>
<h4>How the court determine if I am an employee or an independent contractor?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Integration of activities to the princial's business organization.</li>
<li>Control by the principal over the service to be provided,<br>
and when where and how it is to be performed</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically to see if you part of the business or you are working for your own.</p>
<h2>Hiring interns</h2>
<p>There is no standalone <code>intern</code> section in employment law, so being hired as an intern is the same as being hired as any other employee, and you will get the same protection from the law.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> When a company providing you an <code>intern</code> position it could either be as an employee or an independent contractor.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> <code>co-op</code> job can be paid less, so be notice.</p>
<h2>employment agreement</h2>
<p>Clear and mutual understanding of the expectations and obligations during the relationship.</p>
<p>Any dispute that is not specified on the agreement will be took into common law system which will take a long time.</p>
<p><code>Note</code>: The agreement is unenforceable if it is signed after the person already has the job (for lack of consideration).</p>
<p><code>Note</code>: traps in form of <code>signing bonus</code>, which gives you couple hundered bucks, but need you to agree with a new agreement.</p>
<p><code>Note</code>: <code>signing bonus</code> is also a common way for employers to keep people longer.</p>
<h2>key employment compliance issues</h2>
<h4>Employment standard</h4>
<ul>
<li>Employers need to record keeping, hours of work, minimum wages, overtime pay/time off, vacation time off and pay.</li>
<li>Minimum wages apply to all employees, so you can not say because I am an intern so you pay me less.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Human rights</h4>
<p>...</p>
<h4>Occupational health and safety</h4>
<p>...</p>
<h2>termination of employment</h2>
<p>Termination will happen in two from: &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;without cause&quot;</p>
<h4>Terminated for Cause</h4>
<p>Termination with cause has very high threshold, meaning you need to have serious misconduct.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> If you are simply suck you will not be terminated with cause.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> To file a termination for cause need to go through a very lengthy legal process, so as employer for the effectiveness they won't consider it as the first choice.</p>
<h4>Terminated Without cause</h4>
<p>Most people will be fired by termination without cause. For employer it is more cost effective.</p>
<h4>Former employer can say anything about you as long as it's accurate.</h4>
<p>They can provide the reason of termination to your next employer, your performance etc.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> If they provide incorrect information your right is protected by common law rather than employment law.</p>
<h2>Some governments programs</h2>
<h4>EI employment insurance</h4>
<p>Canadian program for providing temporary income support to unemployed workers while they look for employment or upgrade their skills.</p>
<p>Some categories of EI eligible reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular unemployment</li>
<li>Sickness</li>
<li>Maternity</li>
<li>Parental</li>
<li>Compassionate care</li>
<li>Developmental program</li>
</ul>
<p>Independent worker who also works in <code>insurable employment</code> under a contract of serivce ((Independent Contractors) is eligible for EI.</p>
<p>For <code>insurable employment</code>, if you are a full time employee part of your salary will be deducted for paying EI premiums. But if you are a independent contractor you don't need to pay for that.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> the lost of the job is not fault of you own. (Service Canada has separate process from the court when determing it)</p>
<p><code>Note</code> there is a insurable hours requirement. You need to work in insurable employment in last 52 weeks for 420 - 700 hours. The specific number depends on the local unemployment rate.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> you need to actively seeking for job during the EI covered period. If, for instance, you took a trip to Cuba instead of look for a employment, it will be a EI violation and be put on the record. Consquence is the next time when you're applying for EI you will need a longer insurable employment.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> EI gives you 55% of avg insurable weekly earning, maximum $543 (might change).</p>
<p><code>Note</code> you can apply for family supplement on top of regular EI benefits.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> duration is 14 to 45 weeks.</p>
<p><code>Note</code> working as phd on <a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/personal_finance/investing/2013/10/01/graduate_student_eligible_for_ei_benefits.html">individual research projecet</a> doesn't apply as a job. But working for a professor directed project is likely to be considered.</p>
<h4>CPP Canada Pension Plan</h4>
<p>Candada mandated retirement funding. You need to pay if you are older than 18 and younger than 65, employeed and receive salary.</p>
<p>CPP is automatedly deducted from the income, and it's around 5%-6%. Self-employed people need to pay for both employer and employee portion thus it will be around 10%.</p>
<p>In short, canadian version of retirement funding.</p>
